# Changelog

## 1.6.13
- Fix: `network.async_get_source_ip` call in config flow used the removed `target` kwarg; renamed to `target_ip` (current HA API).
- Fix: circuit devices now link to the bridge device via `via_device_id` (resolved registry id) instead of the deprecated `via_device` identifier tuple.
- Fix: never-polled messages with a `lastup: 0` entry (as opposed to no entry at all) were wrongly treated as already read and never got their initial forced read.
- Fix: passively-monitored multi-field commands (e.g. `SetMode`) are now excluded from forced reads; ebusd cannot answer an active read for them, which was logging `ERR: end of input reached` every cycle.

## 1.6.12
- Catch-up reads now run a few in parallel and use more of each cycle, so entities fill several times faster after a reload.

## 1.6.11
- Fault-memory sensors (`Currenterror`) now show "ok" when there is no fault instead of appearing unavailable.

## 1.6.10
- Rarely-changing values are refreshed every 30 min instead of every 10, so the top-up backlog no longer stays permanently full and entities fill faster after a reload.

## 1.6.9
- Fix: never-polled registers kept filling only until other values aged, then stalled; they now get a small guaranteed quota each cycle and fill completely.

## 1.6.8
- Never-polled registers fill about twice as fast after a restart (still idle-only, so normal traffic stays responsive).

## 1.6.7
- The initial read of never-polled registers is now gentle (only when nothing stale is due, a couple per cycle), so it no longer slows down the bus.

## 1.6.6
- Read-only registers that no bus master polls now get an initial forced read, so their entities become available instead of staying "unavailable".

## 1.6.5
- Every scanned eBUS device now appears with its firmware/hardware even when it exposes no readable values (e.g. the sensoNET gateway).

## 1.6.4
- Auto-removed messages are retried hourly and revived on their own once they decode again, so a corrected CSV definition no longer needs an integration reload.
- Zone name and short-name entities now use a rename icon.

## 1.6.3
- Writable text/date fields (e.g. zone short names) now show up as read-only sensors instead of getting no entity at all.

## 1.6.2
- Messages whose ebusd response keeps failing to decode are dropped from the read rotation, so a wrong CSV definition no longer wastes a read and logs an error every cycle.

## 1.6.1
- Display precision now follows the value divisor, so scaled integers (COP, current power, daily yields) show one decimal instead of being rounded to whole numbers.

## 1.6.0
- New ebusd messages are picked up automatically (periodic definition sync), so an integration reload is no longer needed after editing ebusd config.
- Passively observed command fields (e.g. the regulator's SetMode releasebackup) are exposed as read-only diagnostic sensors, disabled by default.

## 1.5.4
- Rarely-changing config/counter values are topped up only every ~10 min instead of every 90 s, so the top-up converges instead of churning the bus.

## 1.5.3
- Fix: stale values were never topped up because message timestamps need `full`, not `verbose`.

## 1.5.2
- Stale messages are topped up at 20 per cycle while catching up, easing back to 8 once the backlog is gone.

## 1.5.1
- Entities now appear as soon as a value arrives, instead of only those that happened to be cached at startup.

## 1.5.0
- Values the bus refreshes on its own are left untouched; only genuinely stale messages are topped up, a few per cycle.
- Removed the `poll_priority` option: registering hundreds of ebusd polls slowed every value down instead of speeding it up.

## 1.4.0
- New option `fast`: selected messages are read straight from the bus each cycle, so they stay as fresh as the poll interval.

## 1.3.0
- Integration registers ebusd poll priorities itself, so values stay fresh without MQTT (option `poll_priority`, 0 = off).

## 1.2.1
- Sensor display precision derived from the data type (integer registers show without decimals).

## 1.2.0
- New `climate` entity per active heating zone (`Z<n>RoomTemp` / `Z<n>DayTemp` / `Z<n>OpMode`).

## 1.1.0
- New `water_heater` for DHW (`HwcStorageTemp` / `HwcTempDesired` / `HwcOpMode`).
- New `switch` "Warmwasser-Boost" (`HwcSFMode` = load/auto).

## 1.0.0
- Config flow pre-fills the host with the HA IP (editable for remote ebusd).
- First public release (HACS).

## 0.10.0
- Bundled brand icon (`brand/` folder); local icon takes priority over the brands CDN (HA 2026.3+).

## 0.9.0
- Fix: °C setpoints no longer clamped to 0–100 (range −60…150, negative values possible).
- Bridge device is named just "eBUS Bridge"; host exposed as its own text sensor (diagnostic).
- Unit tests for `model.py` + CI (hassfest, HACS, ruff, pytest); `codeowners` set.

## 0.8.0
- Bridge diagnostics from ebusd's global section (signal, symbol rate, reconnects, masters, QQ, version).
- Enhanced timing (arbitration/latency) as diagnostics, disabled by default.

## 0.7.3
- Icon heuristic, unit-first: temperatures always as a thermometer variant.

## 0.7.2
- Meaningful mdi icons for all entities instead of generic slider symbols.

## 0.7.1
- Clean per-circuit device names (no "ebusd" prefix); bridge parent device, circuits as children (`via_device`).

## 0.7.0
- Writable calendar (create/update/delete) once ebusd exposes a timer write message.

## 0.6.0
- New `ebus_bridge.write` service (generic pass-through to ebusd's `write`, with read-back).

## 0.5.0
- Renamed to "eBUS Bridge" (domain `ebus_bridge`); new switch platform; `issue_tracker` added.

## 0.4.1
- Fix: forced read after each write so setpoints don't fall to "unavailable".

## 0.4.0
- New binary_sensor + calendar (read-only) platforms; options flow (poll interval, exclude).

## 0.3.0
- Switched to ebusd HTTP-JSON (read) + TCP (write); field-based entity model; device metadata.
